Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

(If upgrading from 1.x or 2.0, you will need to apply these changes)
- Remove any calls to Daemon::setFilename(). The filename is now determined programmatically.
- Replace any calls to Daemon::filename() with Daemon::get('filename')
- Replace any calls to Daemon::verbose() with Daemon::is('verbose')
- Replace any calls to Daemon::shutdown() with Daemon::is('shutdown')
- If you have any classes that implement Core_ITask you must add the method "group()" to those classes. (Returning an empty string is fine)

(Note that is() and get() are aliases of the same method. The convention is to use is() when calling a boolean value.)

Application-Wide changes:
- Instance variable $is_parent is removed from several classes in favor of reading the 'parent' env variable

Changes to the Core_Worker API
- Constructor signature modified: Core_IWorkerVia argument required in the 3rd position.
- Instance variable $ftok removed.
- Instance variable $id renamed to $guid.
- Instance method id() renamed to guid().
- Debug command 'show', which displays a selected call id from the queue is changed to display a call from the local calls array, and accordingly:
- Debug command 'show local' is removed.

Changes to the Core_Daemon API
- Static method setFilename() removed.
- Static method set() created to set application-wide environment variables.
- Static method get() created to read application-wide environment variables.
- Static method filename() removed, you can read the filename using Core_Daemon::get('filename')
- Static variable parent_pid removed, parent_pid added as an env variable
- Static method parent_id removed, you can access the parent_pid variable using Core_Daemon get()
- Instance variable $verbose removed. Now saved in the $env registry.
- Instance method verbose() removed. You can now use static methods get(), is() and set().
- Instance variable $shutdown removed. Now saved in the $env registry.
- Instance method shutdown() removed. You can now use the static methods get(), is() and set().
- Instance variable $daemon removed. Now saved in the $env registry.
- Instance method is_daemon() removed. You can now use the static methods get() and is().

Changes to the Core_ITask API
- New instance method added to the interface: group().

To Do:
- Consider what other vars we can move into the $env dictionary instead of thier own instance vas in Core_Daemon
